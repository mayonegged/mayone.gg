Hi!
This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). Nothing is particularly organized - just disjointed notes I like to have available for friends.

## **ü•öWho I am:**
My name is Michael Beresin. I work in digital advertising, and have been part of [Labelium](https://www.labelium.com/wien) for over 15 years. 

## **üçúWhat I care about:**
I love food, games, cats and books. I also enjoy my work. Advertising can get a bad rep, but there is an awesome mix of puzzle solving and real-time excitement when it is executed with a bit of passion.
I get to think about the way people interact with the web and with AI. Most of my work today is focused on how businesses should face a future with an increasingly entropic, partially useless internet. I travel regularly, and sometimes enjoy it. (mostly when I get to go to Japan)
